## What is this?
Zilophos' Item Editor, or ZIE for short, is a utility tool built with MWSE that is designed to give modders and players alike total control over the items, powers, and spell effects in their game. ZIE provides players with an in-game item editor that can be used to edit item stats on-the-fly as you play, which are updated in real time. No need to restart Morrowind for the changes to take effect. Save bloat is also not an issue, as all changes are global and saved within the mod's config file. This config file can also be shared, allowing you to share your balance changes with others.

*Note: This mod was created for the vanilla game, and will NOT work on OpenMW!*



## Usage:

1. Open the mod config menu in-game, and navigate to the Zilophos' Item Editor MCM.
2. Find and select your item from the given categories.
3. Edit the stats as you see fit, and save your changes.

If you make a mistake, items can also be reset to their default values in the MCM.
